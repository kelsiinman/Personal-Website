		<h2 class="WIK"> What I Know </h2>
		<p class="intro" > During my Bachelor's program, I had exposure to many  programming languages such as Java, Processing, Python, HTML, and many more! I also took classes outside of the department to broaden my  area of expertise such as Social Media, Digital Tools and Graphic Design, Creative Writing, and others. Simultaneously, I continued to solely learn French, which I can speak, read, and write intermediatley. </p> </div>

	<h2> What I Bring </h2>
 <p class="intro2"> I love laughing and providing a comfortable and safe environment for people around me to interact with. In a place of employment, not only will I bring these qualities, but also professionalism and open communication. I have been working since the age of 15, and consider my work-ethic one of my best qualities. I am very open and creative minded, as well as approachable and teachable. I love receiving critiques on how I can be better regarding my professional, and personal, life.
