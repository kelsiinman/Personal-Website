			<h2 class="WIK"> What I Know </h2> 
				<p class="intro1" > 
					During my Bachelor's program, I had exposure to many  programming languages such as Java, 
					Processing, Python, Ruby, and others. I also took classes outside of the department to broaden my 
					area of expertise such as Social Media, Digital Tools and Graphic Design, Creative Writing, and others.
					Simultaneously, I continued to solely learn French, which I can speak, read, and write intermediatley.

			<h2 class="WIB"> What I Would Bring </h2>
				<p class="intro2"> I love laughing and providing a comfortable and safe environment for people around me to interact with.
					In a place of employment, not only will I bring these qualities, but also professionalism and open communication.
					I have been working since the age of 15, and consider my work-ethic one of my best qualities. 
					I am approachable and teachable, and my past employers would commend me on my trustworthiness and reliability. 
					I appreciate receiving critiques on how I can improve in my professional, and personal, life.</p> </div> </br>
